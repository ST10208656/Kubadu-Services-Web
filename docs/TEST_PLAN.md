# Kubadu Admin Test Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Kubadu Admin application. The test plan covers different types of testing, test environments, and testing procedures to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

## 2. Test Environment

### 2.1 Technical Requirements
- Node.js environment
- Jest testing framework
- JSDOM for DOM manipulation testing
- Code coverage reporting tools

### 2.2 Test Configuration
- Jest as the primary testing framework
- JSDOM for browser environment simulation
- Babel for JavaScript transformation
- Coverage reports generated in the `/coverage` directory

## 3. Types of Testing

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual components and functions in isolation
- Focus on pure JavaScript functions and utility methods
- Ensure each component behaves as expected independently

#### Key Areas:
- Utility functions
- Component logic
- Data transformations
- State management functions

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- Test interaction between multiple components
- Verify proper communication between different parts of the application
- Test data flow between components

#### Key Areas:
- API interactions
- Component interactions
- Event handling between components
- Data flow validation

### 3.3 UI Testing
- Test user interface components
- Verify proper rendering and styling
- Test user interactions and event handling

#### Key Areas:
- Component rendering
- User input handling
- UI state changes
- Responsive design testing

### 3.4 End-to-End Testing
- Test complete user workflows
- Verify application behavior from start to finish
- Test real-world scenarios

#### Key Areas:
- User workflows
- Form submissions
- Navigation flows
- Error handling

## 4. Test Organization

### 4.1 Directory Structure
```
/test
  /unit          # Unit tests
  /integration   # Integration tests
  /e2e          # End-to-end tests
  /__mocks__     # Mock files and data
  /setup.js      # Test setup configuration
```

### 4.2 Naming Conventions
- Test files: `[component-name].test.js`
- Test suites: Describe blocks should clearly indicate the component/feature being tested
- Test cases: Should clearly describe the expected behavior

## 5. Testing Practices

### 5.1 Code Coverage
- Minimum coverage threshold: 80%
- Areas to cover:
  - Branches
  - Functions
  - Lines
  - Statements

### 5.2 Test Data Management
- Use mock data for API responses
- Maintain fixtures in separate files
- Use consistent test data across related tests

### 5.3 Mocking Strategy
- Mock external dependencies
- Mock API calls
- Mock browser APIs when necessary

## 6. Continuous Integration

### 6.1 CI Pipeline
- Run tests on every pull request
- Run tests before deployment
- Generate and store coverage reports

### 6.2 Quality Gates
- All tests must pass
- Coverage thresholds must be met
- No new bugs in SonarQube analysis

## 7. Bug Tracking and Reporting

### 7.1 Bug Reports
- Include test case that exposes the bug
- Document expected vs actual behavior
- Include steps to reproduce

### 7.2 Test Results
- Generate detailed test reports
- Track test execution time
- Monitor test stability

## 8. Maintenance

### 8.1 Test Maintenance
- Regular review and updates of test cases
- Remove obsolete tests
- Update tests when requirements change

### 8.2 Documentation
- Keep test documentation up to date
- Document testing procedures
- Maintain changelog of test changes

## 9. Resources

### 9.1 Tools
- Jest Documentation
- JSDOM Documentation
- Coverage Tools Documentation

### 9.2 References
- Testing Best Practices
- Jest API Reference
- Team Testing Guidelines
