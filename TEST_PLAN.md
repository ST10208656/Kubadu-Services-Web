# Kubadu Services Test Plan

## 1. Overview
This test plan outlines the testing strategy for the Kubadu Services Android application. The plan covers different types of testing to ensure the application's quality, reliability, and performance.

## 2. Test Types

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual components and classes in isolation
- Focus on business logic and data processing
- Use JUnit for test implementation
- Target coverage: 80% of business logic

#### Key Areas:
- Data models and entities
- Repository classes
- Use case implementations
- Utility functions
- ViewModels

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- Test interaction between components
- Verify data flow between layers
- Test database operations
- Test network calls and API integration

#### Key Areas:
- Repository integration with local database
- API service integration
- Data synchronization
- Component communication

### 2.3 UI Testing
- Verify UI components and user flows
- Test UI state management
- Verify navigation
- Test input validation

#### Key Areas:
- Screen navigation
- Form validation
- UI state updates
- User interaction handling
- Error message display

### 2.4 Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Memory usage
- Battery consumption
- Network bandwidth usage
- App launch time
- Screen transition time

### 2.5 Security Testing
- Data encryption
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Secure storage
- Network security

## 3. Test Environment

### 3.1 Development Environment
- Android Studio
- Emulators with different API levels
- Physical devices for final validation

### 3.2 Test Frameworks and Tools
- JUnit for unit testing
- Espresso for UI testing
- Mockito for mocking
- JaCoCo for code coverage
- Firebase Test Lab for device testing

## 4. Test Cases Organization

### 4.1 Unit Tests
- Place in `src/test` directory
- Follow naming convention: `[Class]Test`
- Group by feature/component

### 4.2 Instrumentation Tests
- Place in `src/androidTest` directory
- Follow naming convention: `[Feature]InstrumentedTest`
- Organize by user flow/feature

## 5. Continuous Integration

### 5.1 Automated Testing
- Run unit tests on every commit
- Run UI tests on pull requests
- Generate and publish coverage reports
- Automated device testing on Firebase Test Lab

### 5.2 Manual Testing
- Smoke testing on release candidates
- Exploratory testing for new features
- Cross-device testing for critical flows

## 6. Bug Tracking
- Use GitHub Issues for bug tracking
- Include steps to reproduce
- Add relevant logs and screenshots
- Tag with severity and priority
- Link to related test cases

## 7. Test Deliverables
- Test cases documentation
- Test execution reports
- Code coverage reports
- Performance test results
- Security audit reports
- Bug reports and tracking

## 8. Risk Analysis
- Device fragmentation
- Network conditions
- API dependencies
- Data migration
- Performance on low-end devices

## 9. Exit Criteria
- All critical and high-priority tests pass
- Code coverage meets target
- No critical or high-severity bugs
- Performance metrics within acceptable range
- Security requirements met

## 10. Test Schedule
- Unit tests: Continuous with development
- Integration tests: Weekly
- UI tests: Before each release
- Performance tests: Bi-weekly
- Security testing: Monthly
- Full regression: Before major releases
